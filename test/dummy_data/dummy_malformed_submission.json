      "answer": "A minor corneal abrasion can take 1-3 days to heal on its own [32091909]. However, this timeframe may vary depending on the severity and location of the injury. Studies have shown that most superficial corneal abrasions will recover in a week or less with minimal treatment [28678410]. The healing process may be slowed in people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or vitamin deficiencies. In general, if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 3-5 days, medical attention should be sought. Delaying treatment can lead to complications and prolonged recovery times. [31886449]",
